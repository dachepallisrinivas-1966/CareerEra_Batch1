2)  accept dd, mm, yy. check whether it is valid date or not.
        eg: 
            dd : 6
            mm : 8
            yy : 2022
        output : validate

            dd : 31

17) Write a program to find the EB bill with the given inputs,
	input1="abc2012345"
	input2="abc2012660"
	input3=4

	In the given input1 "abc20" refers to customer id and 12345 refers to the last month
	EB reading, 
	similarly from input2 “abc20” refers to customer id and 12660 refers to this month EB reading.

	Find the difference between two reading 12660 and 12345 and multiply it by input3.

	Sample Output
	Output=(12660-12345)*4
	Output=1260


18) Find the max length-word in each string and return the max-length word. 
    if two words are of same length return the first occurring word of max-length.

	input: "hello how are you Jenny"
	output: hello(length-5)	


19) Given a string, reverse the string and parse it with '-'.

	input:computer
	output:r-e-t-u-p-m-o-c

20) Given two strings, If the two strings are of same length concatenate them, if
    they are not of same length, reduce the longer string to size of smaller one, and
    concatenate them.

	input1:"hello"
	input2:"hai"
	output:"llohai"


21) Create a ContactManagementApplication to manage all of your contacts.
    Use Collections to store contacts.

	contactId, fullName, mobile, email

	LIST, ADD, REMOVE, QUIT


22) Upgrade ContactManagementApplication to use IOStreams to store the contacts permanantly.

23) update a job in jobs table using PreparedStatement
24) delete a job in jobs table using PreparedStatement
